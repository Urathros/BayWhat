# BayWhat?!?

### Summary
Our entry for the third SAE Munich Game Jam in 2025 with our interpretation of the Jams topic: 80s Beach Party. 
You play as the lifeguard during on of the many beach parties, avoid obstacles and drunk partygoers and keep the party folk from drowning to gain points.
Watch out for sharks though!

It features a large tilebased level, custom composed music, retro pixel artstyles, animated backgrounds, the occasional bug, a serialized highscore and of course the 80s beach feeling.
On the technical side the game was realized using the [Black Coat Game Engine](https://github.com/Neovex/BlackCoat) and the [Tiled Level Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org).
